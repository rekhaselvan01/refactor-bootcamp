"Refactor-bootcamp"


In this project, I have a basic html that creates a webpage and a css file that styles all the css properties for the webelements.

As per the client's request, the code file has repetitions and needs refactoring to organize the semantics and improve accessibility. Hence this project was implemented.

I saw that many classes in the css file had same properties but were not organized. There were blocks of code repeating themselves. Hence I grouped the classes which had the same properties together, thereby reducing the number of code from 200 to 135.

I also added alt attribute to links and images to improve accessibility. Also I added comments wherever neccessary to improve the quality.

Here, I attach the link to the deployed application:
